List of vector embedding methods in increasing difficulty :

* **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):**
    * **Description:** Assigns a weight to each word in a document based on its frequency within that document and its rarity across the entire collection of documents, creating a weighted frequency vector.
    * **Common Use Cases:** Document similarity, information retrieval, keyword extraction, text classification (as features).

* **Bag-of-Words (BoW):**
    * **Description:** Represents a document as a vector where each dimension corresponds to a unique word in the vocabulary, and the value is the frequency of that word in the document. It disregards grammar and word order.
    * **Common Use Cases:** Simple text classification, spam detection, basic document clustering.

* **N-gram Models:**
    * **Description:** Extends BoW by considering sequences of N words (e.g., "bag of words" as a single unit), capturing some local word order, and representing their frequencies.
    * **Common Use Cases:** Text classification, language modeling, spell checking, sentiment analysis.

* **GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation):**
    * **Description:** An unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words, combining global matrix factorization and local context window methods. It effectively captures both global statistics and local context.

* **Doc2Vec (PV-DM, PV-DBOW):**
    * **Description:** An extension of Word2Vec that learns fixed-length feature representations (vectors) for documents, regardless of their length, by either predicting words from document vectors (PV-DBOW) or words and context from document vectors (PV-DM).
    * **Common Use Cases:** Document similarity, document clustering, text classification, content recommendation.

* **Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA):**
    * **Description:** Applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to the term-document matrix (often TF-IDF), reducing dimensionality and revealing latent semantic relationships between words and documents.
    * **Common Use Cases:** Information retrieval, document clustering, cross-language retrieval, topic modeling.

* **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA):**
    * **Description:** A generative probabilistic model that assumes documents are a mixture of topics, and each topic is a distribution over words; it infers these topics and assigns a topic distribution (vector) to each document.
    * **Common Use Cases:** Topic modeling, document organization, recommendation systems (topic-based), content analysis.

* **InferSent:**
    * **Description:** A sentence embedding method trained using a bidirectional LSTM network on natural language inference (NLI) datasets, producing general-purpose sentence representations.
    * **Common Use Cases:** Semantic textual similarity, natural language inference, paraphrasing, question answering.

    * **Common Use Cases:** Semantic similarity, clustering, classification, question answering, conversational agents.

* **ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models):**
    * **Description:** Learns contextualized word embeddings by using a deep bidirectional LSTM model that processes words from both directions, generating different embeddings for the same word based on its context.
    * **Common Use Cases:** Named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, question answering, improved performance on various NLP tasks.

* **BERT (and its variants like RoBERTa, DistilBERT, ALBERT, etc.):**
    * **Description:** A transformer-based neural network model pre-trained on large text corpora using masked language modeling and next sentence prediction, excelling at capturing contextual word relationships.

* **Sentence-BERT (SBERT):**
    * **Description:** Modifies pre-trained BERT networks to produce semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared directly using cosine similarity, overcoming BERT's limitation of unsuitability for direct sentence similarity.
    * **Common Use Cases:** Semantic search, clustering, paraphrase mining, few-shot learning, recommendation.

* **Transformer-XL:**

    * **Common Use Cases:** Long text generation, language modeling, machine translation for longer sequences.

* **XLNet:**
    * **Description:** A generalized autoregressive pre-training method that leverages the strengths of both autoregressive models (like Transformer-XL) and autoencoding models (like BERT) for better context learning.
