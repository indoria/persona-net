Hope you’re doing well! I wanted to share a story that I think could be a strong fit for your coverage of workplace tools and the future of work.

We’ve just launched TaskPilot, a smart task coordination platform designed to help remote teams replace status meetings with actionable async updates. Built by ex-Slack and Trello engineers, TaskPilot syncs task progress across tools like Notion, Asana, and Google Docs — and uses lightweight AI to summarize daily priorities without the need for live check-ins.

Since launching in private beta 6 weeks ago, TaskPilot has:

Onboarded over 2,000 remote workers
Helped teams reduce stand-up meeting time by an average of 40%
Been adopted by fast-growing companies like Arcbyte, Vanta, and Clario

We’d love to offer you an early look or exclusive interview with our co-founder, Maya Chen, who previously led product at Trello and has some fascinating insights on the async-first workplace trend.

Let me know if you’d be interested in chatting or need more details. Happy to send over our press kit or set up a quick call.

Thanks so much for your time!">TaskPilot async work platform launch</option>
